This is an exploratory data analysis project aiming at answering business questions about a company sales trend. 
Three main libraries used are pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. 
The five business questions are:
  1. Which month has the highest sales revenue?
  2. Which city has the highest number of sales?
  3. Which time should the company display ads to maximize the likelihood of customers buying products?
  4. Which products are most often sold together?
  5. Which products are sold the most? Why do you think they are the most sold?
Functions mostly employed in this project are groupby() and basic stats functions (count(), sum(), mean()). In order for readers to read and understand the project, simple bar plots are used to visualize the data.
