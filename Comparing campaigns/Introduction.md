A/B Testing

Also known as a split test or bucket test, A/B testing is a research methodology used to compare two versions of the same subject matter to find out which version is better.
A/B testing can be used in marketing to test two marketing campaigns to see which one increase website traffic, boost ad clicks or sales, etc. 

A/B testing helps in finding a better approach to finding customers, marketing products, getting a higher reach, or anything that helps a business convert most of its target customers into actual customers.

Two datasets used in this project are:
•	Test campaign
•	Control campaign

Features of the dataset:
•	Campaign name: Name of the campaign
•	Date: Date of the record
•	Spend: Amount spent on the campaign in US dollars
•	of Impressions: ad impressions throughout the campaign
•	Reach: the number of unique impressions received in the ads
•	of Website clicks: number of clicks received through the ads
•	of Searchers: number of users who performed searches on the website
•	of View Content: number of users who viewed content and products on the website
•	of Add to Cart: number of users who added products to cart
•	of Purchase: number of purchases

Before analyzing data, I did some data cleaning, including:
•	Changing column names to make them readable
•	Checking and replacing missing values
•	Merging tables for the purpose of data analysis.

This project used Plotly as main data visualization tool. 
(** This is the first time I learned and used some packages of Plotly for data visualization, so my project looked a little messy)
•	I haven’t figured out yet how to show plotly graph/chart along with codes; however, I was able to turned them into .png file so I uploaded the images.
