### Business Goal
To divide customers into groups based on demographics (age, income) and behavorial characteristics (spending habit) to create niche marketing targeting specific groups that generate the most revenues for the store. 

### Approach
Since the dataset used in this project is not labeled, we would employ unsupervised machine learning methods, specifically K-Means Clustering in this business scenario. This method groups customers into clusters based on certain characteristics we define. In our business problem, we would segment cusomters based on two criteria - annual income and spending score. 

### Result
We would focus on group(s) that has high annual income and high spending score as they bring us the most revenues. We can also examine the group that has high spending score but low to medium income. We can further look at their spending habit and create a one-time event marketing annually to attract this group and boost sales.

**NOTE**
I made a mistake in the conclusion about bivariate analysis. The cluster that has high annual income and high spending score is cluster 3, NOT cluster 0.
