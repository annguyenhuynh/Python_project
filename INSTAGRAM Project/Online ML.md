This project explores the online machine learning methodology, particularly the PassiveAgressiveRegressor. 

We know that nowadays, companies and brands take advantage of social media to market and promote their products and services. The main point is how to expose their marketing campaigns to as many targeted and new customers as possible. 

An online machine-learning model can offer a solution. I recently completed a project guided by 'Aman Kharwal,' where data from Instagram are collected and analyzed to detect where impressions mainly come from. The model also helps business predict impressions. 

We want to use online machine learning type because the model can train the data incrementally by feeding its instances with new data sequentially. As data on social media is ever changing, applying traditional ML models is not effective, but an online ML model that can keep up with continuous data coming in will yield more accurate results in when building predictive models.
