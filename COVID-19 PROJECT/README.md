* This project is a final personal project in Programming for Analytics course at George Mason University by Professor Belal Abdelfattah.
* The main purpose of the project is to report statistics about Covid-19 cases that are relevant to the county inputted by end users.
* Beside descriptive statistics, two plots are provided to help users understand the trend of the pandemic within a county and the general differences among counties within  a state.
